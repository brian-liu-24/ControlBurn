# ControlBurn
Feature Selection via Sparse Forests. Notebooks and data to reproduce experiments. The majority of the data is available through the PMLB benchmarking package in Python (https://github.com/EpistasisLab/pmlb) or through a URL import from UCI MLR (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php). The functions to load the data are included in the Python notebooks. One additional dataset is included as a csv.
